# Melon Survey

This is just a very simple web-based survey program specifically written for
one particular survey...

I tend to publish all my source code, so this one is no exception. Just know
that it's not really designed for general purpose use.

## Build

```
go build
```

## Run

It listens on `127.0.0.1:9074`. Point your reverse proxy there, and remember to
send a `X-Forwarded-For`.
